# Banking System in C++

This project is a small banking system program developed for fun and learning purposes. It is not a full-fledged banking system but rather a work in progress. The program is designed to perform basic banking tasks such as storing user details in files, implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a text file format, and providing a user-friendly Command Line Interface (CLI). Additionally, animations using C++ are incorporated to enhance the user experience.
